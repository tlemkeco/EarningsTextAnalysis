       "FDA decision on glycopyrronium tosylate New Drug Application expected by June 30, 2018\n",
       "Lebrikizumab Phase 2b study enrolling patients, data expected in first half of 2019\n",
       "MENLO PARK, Calif., May  03, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dermira, Inc. (NASDAQ:DERM), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its clinical development programs.\n",
       "“For the past eight years, Dermira has been working towards its goal of offering new therapies for the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions, and 2018 promises to be an exciting year as we expect to complete our journey from a development stage to a commercial stage company,” said Tom Wiggans, chairman and chief executive officer of Dermira. “The second half of 2018 holds great potential for the company as we await a decision on our new drug application for glycopyrronium tosylate as a potential treatment option for the millions of people suffering from axillary hyperhidrosis and aim to complete the enrollment of our lebrikizumab Phase 2b trial.”\n",
       "Operational Highlights and Clinical Pipeline Update\n",
       "In April 2018, Dermira announced the appointment of Christopher Horan as Chief Technical Operations Officer. In this newly created role, Chris will oversee pharmaceutical sciences, procurement, supply chain, including contract manufacturing, and quality as Dermira prepares to commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate (formerly DRM04). \n",
       "In March 2018, Dermira announced that the investigational treatment olumacostat glasaretil (formerly DRM01) did not meet the co-primary endpoints in its two Phase 3 pivotal trials (CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2) in patients ages nine years and older with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, and the company expects to discontinue the program. \n",
       "In February 2018, Dermira presented new findings from its glycopyrronium tosylate Phase 3 clinical program. The data showed that when applied topically, the investigational therapy improved disease severity, reduced sweat production and was associated with improved quality of life outcomes for pediatric patients (ages 9 to 16) with primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating), compared to vehicle-treated patients. \n",
       "In January 2018, Dermira announced the initiation of a Phase 2b dose-ranging study evaluating lebrikizumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2b study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program. Lebrikizumab is a novel, humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind to IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing formation of the IL-13 receptor/IL-4 receptor complex and subsequent signaling. IL-13 plays a central role in type 2 inflammation and is an important pathogenic mediator in atopic dermatitis. The study is expected to enroll approximately 275 patients. Topline results are expected in the first half of 2019.\n",
       "Financial Highlights\n",
       "First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\n",
       "For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Dermira reported a net loss of $59.3 million, compared with a net loss of $29.5 million for the same period in 2017.  \n",
       "Total operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $57.2 million, compared to $31.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher personnel-related and commercial readiness expenses.  Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $25.6 million, compared to $19.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. This increase was primarily driven by clinical trial activities for the lebrikizumab and olumacostat glasaretil product candidates and higher personnel-related expenses, offset by a decrease in clinical trial activities for the Cimzia program. \n",
       "General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $30.5 million, compared to $11.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher personnel-related and commercial readiness expenses. \n",
       "\n",
       "As of March 31, 2018, Dermira had cash and investments of $495.8 million, and 41.8 million common shares outstanding.\n",
       "Key Milestones and Expectations\n",
       "Hold the company’s inaugural analyst and investor day on May 24, 2018 to review the company’s commercial activities for glycopyrronium tosylate and its pipeline and issue financial guidance.\n",
       "Initiate the second phase of the hyperhidrosis disease state awareness campaign in the second quarter of 2018.\n",
       "If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), launch glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis in the second half of 2018.\n",
